# Topic 001: Spring Bean, Dependency injection(DI) in Spring Boot

> What is Spring Bean?

    1. Beans are objects that form the pivotal part of your application. They are instantiated, assembled, and managed by the Spring IoC container.

    2. The beans are built with configuration metadata that are provided to the container. This configuration data determines the bean behavior.

> Configuring Spring Bean

    1. XML based configuration file
    2. Annotation-based configuration
    3. Java-based configuration

> Bean Scopes

    While defining a bean you can declare a scope for the bean.

    E.g., to force Spring to create a new bean instance every time, you must declare the scope attribute of the bean to be prototype.

    If you require Spring to return the same bean instance every time, you must declare the scope attribute of the bean to be singleton.

    There are five types of Scopes defined

        1. singleton
        2. prototype
        3. request
        4. session
        5. global-session
